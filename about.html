        <h1>About me</h1><hr>
        <p>I came to the US when I was around 10 years old right before the pandemic and moved to queens like a year later. I graduated 
         Middle school with honors in 2022. I became a student at <a href="https://www.taehs.org/">Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical
          High school.</a> I joined some clubs and created one club while I was in Edison called <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">
         Girls who code</a> I was also Web master for two clubs, Fashion and Design club and Softball club.</p><hr>
